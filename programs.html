							<h6>Martial Arts Isn't Just for Kids</h6>
							  <p>While our martial arts training is an excellent personal-development activity for children, it’s great for adults also.</p>
							  <p>Our Stony Brook Martial Arts adult students usually find that they cope better with stress, sleep better at night, work better during the day and just feel better overall. They also have a greater peace of mind due to the knowledge and expertise on what to do if faced with a dangerous situation.</p>
							  <p>However, the greatest benefit of martial arts at Ultimate Taekwondo of Stony Brook for adults is the increased sense of self confidence it builds.</p>
							  <p>No matter what the style of martial arts — whether it’s karate, kung fu, taekwondo, jujitso, judo, aikido, tai chi or kendo — the physical and mental benefits are similar.</p>
							  <p>All of the martial arts Stony Brook classes are individualized. Adults participate at their own fitness level while progressing in skill and technique.</p>
							  <p>When participating as a family, martial arts provide a unique opportunity for sharing in a non-competitive fun activity. Plus, parents have the opportunity to reinforce the life lessons taught in our martial arts classes at home.</p>
							  <p>Stony Brook Martial Arts provide an ideal workout for both men and women. Our adult martial arts students range in age from young adult to seniors.</p>
